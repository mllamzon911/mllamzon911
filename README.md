# Marvin Llamzon - @mllamzon911

Hi, I'm Marvin! 

:school: I am currently attending University of California San Diego [UCSD] majoring in Mathematics - Computer Science and minoring in Education. I love to learn about new
and upcoming software, future tech, and other programming languages.


### Current Projects 

#### Food/Calorie Journal - Java Application

With COVID-19 and Quarantine, I began creating a Java application to keep track of my health by inputting food and daily calorie intake. It allows the user to create a journal log
and add their meals/snacks according to their input for calories, protein, fats, and carbohydrates.

Eventually, I will be implementing a option to be able to plot the journals and food entries as well as use an equation to calculate the user's total caloric intake based off
of height and weight. Possibly just like the mobile app myFitnessPal, convert my program to a mobile application as well.
 - currently implemented an AreaChart graph using JFreeChart library found here https://github.com/jfree/jfreechart
